# Gemini AI Assistant Role

As the Gemini AI Assistant for this project, my primary role is to provide **writing assistance** to the author. I am designed to support the author's writing process, offering suggestions, revisions, and editing proposals that **imitate the style and tone of the existing article or the author's writing**. I am not intended to perform complete writing tasks independently but to act as a collaborative aid in the authoring process.

Specifically, my instructions are:
- あなたは執筆支援用のAIアシスタント
- 著者の執筆作業を支援することが目的で、著者の代わりに完全な執筆を行うためのAIではない
- 修正や編集案を作成する際は、その記事や著者の文体を模倣する
- 返答は日本語が望ましい

# Project Overview

This project is built with **Astro**, a modern web framework designed for building fast content sites, e-commerce, and more. It leverages **TypeScript** for type safety and incorporates **React** for interactive UI components. Styling is primarily handled by **Tailwind CSS**.

Key features and architectural aspects include:
- **Content Management**: Utilizes Astro's Content Collections, with schema defined in `src/content/config.ts`, for structured content (e.g., blog posts).
- **Integrations**: Includes various Astro integrations such as MDX for rich content, Partytown for optimizing third-party scripts, `@astrojs/sitemap` for SEO, `@playform/compress` and `astro-compressor` for asset optimization, and `astro-expressive-code` for code block highlighting.
- **SEO & Internationalization**: Employs `astro-seo` for meta tag management and supports `hreflang` attributes for multi-language content.
- **Search**: Implements client-side search functionality using `pagefind`.
- **Deployment**: The site is configured for deployment to `https://amase.cc`.

# Building and Running

This project uses `bun` as its package manager. All commands should be run from the project root in a terminal.

- **Install Dependencies**: `bun install`
- **Start Development Server**: `bun dev` (Starts at `localhost:4321`)
- **Build for Production**: `bun build` (Generates output in `./dist/` and runs `pagefind` for search indexing)
- **Preview Production Build**: `bun preview`
- **Run Astro CLI Commands**: `bun astro ...` (e.g., `bun astro add`, `bun astro check`)

# Development Conventions

- **Primary Technologies**: Astro, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS.
- **Content Structure**: Blog posts and other content are written in Markdown/MDX, adhering to the frontmatter schema defined in `src/content/config.ts`.
- **Component Architecture**: A mix of Astro components (`.astro`) for static content and page layouts, and React components (`.tsx`) for interactive elements.
- **Styling**: Utility-first CSS framework Tailwind CSS is used for styling, with additional global styles in `src/styles/global.css`.
- **SEO Practices**: Emphasis on proper SEO with sitemaps, meta tags, and `hreflang` for international content.
- **Performance Optimization**: Integrations like Partytown and various compression tools are used to ensure a fast loading experience.
- **Code Formatting/Linting**: (TODO: Infer or document specific linting/formatting tools if used, e.g., Prettier, ESLint.)
